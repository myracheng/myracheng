MIT Confessions
February 25 at 8:30 PM · 
Hi all. For the past few years MIT Confessions has been passed down from admin to admin, with the general instructions becoming “post things that aren’t obviously troll posts”. As the current admins, we found this instruction simple at first, but over time things became complex as the page grew more popular and more and more people submitted confessions. Retroactively, we realize the change we had made in the posting styles for confessions wasn’t for the better. With that, we...

#20583 @20507 How misguided are you to be pissed off about a rent-a-cop telling you not to go inside a tent? There's an event. It's not public. Someone getting paid to stand outside a door probably doesn't give a shit about you, MIT, or the speakers. Why on earth would you harass some dude just putting in his hours and make a fuss about the deprioritization of "the quotidian education of the studentry", instead of walking around the tent and going to class? Is this the state of activism at MIT?

#20579 <mini-rant>
I wish smoking culture was still widely accepted. 
I get that there are communities that let you smoke inside your living quarters... but what if I wanna smoke a nice cigarette while I'm reading in a classroom? 
Like I get it, smoking is bad, but I hate having to walk outside just to enjoy a smoke break.
I wish that we could open up a smoking admissible lounge....

Thank you for coming to my TED talk

#20573 Sometimes I have dreams where I'm lost in space. My oxygen is low and I have no way of returning to earth. Suddenly, I see a bright star travelling towards me. It's Xavier Zapien! He's come to save me! But wait, why does he only have one oxygen tank? He starts taking off my oxygen tank and replacing it with his. Then, he uses the last of his dying energy to accelerate me toward Earth. As I fall back to the motherland, I see Xavier's face shriveling from the vacuum of space. He looks like a raisin, but that's my raisin. Thank you Xavier-chan

#20569 Like others, I believe New Vassar Dorm is a very bad name. I have a good idea, I wish the student leaders can carry it forward.
Name the MIT Dorm as Tomlinson Hall. After Ray Tomlinson, the email pioneer. 
Reason:
In the MIT150 list of most influential MIT people, among the top 5, Tim Berners-Lee, Eric Lander and Philip Sharp are still alive. William Shockley is a no-no because of his racism. So, that leaves Ray Tomlinson, rest in peace. We all know that his work was g...

#20562 Keep the life and the family of Anthony Costa Jr. in your minds and hearts. He was a worker killed yesterday by scaffolding that fell at the construction site for the new Vassar dorm. Two other men are hospitalized with injuries. Whether this was a no-fault accident or the result of unsafe working conditions (investigation ongoing), MIT should be there for his loved ones and the injured. Costa was a member of the MIT community, even if, as a contracted worker, some others fail to recognize his value. Where is the email in his memory? This isn't just political; this is what is happening on our campus.

#20560 If MIT cared about their students, they would let BC residents move with their living groups to the Vassar dorm during renovations. It’s not even the culture aspect, it’s the fact that these are tight knit communities where residents feel safe talking to their fellow residents. Taking this away from those students, especially those who love their floors and primarily socialize there, is detrimental to both them and the greater MIT community.

If you have a problem with MIT admitting people who grew up with financial and/or educational privilege that's fine, but having a specific problem with admitting black/Hispanic privileged students makes the assumption that those people are inherently unqualified and...

#20557 Yet another survey from admin. While I'm generally satisfied with my MIT experience, I'll for sure be putting the most negative response for all the "does admin care about you" questions, and I encourage others to do the same, and here's why.
While my feelings aren't necessarily that extreme, more that I'm worried any answer that isn't the most extreme will be lumped in with all the ""these student's aren't extremely dissatisfied therefore they are satisfied"" responses. I wish I didn't have to worry about my opinion being misrepresented like this, but all the recent inaccurate data portrayals re:housing has made me defensive.

#20539 Though a series of unforeseen struggles continues to hold back the project, I'm getting closer than ever. One day, you'll finally understand why I had to do everything I did.
I'm proud to have liked you. May you find your special someone, and may that relationship be simple and delightful. Have a wonderful life.

#20535 Honestly, can we change the MacGregor fire alarm to only say the "if the alarm sounds in your half of the building, please evacuate" ONCE? Where I come from, if you hear the fire alarm, you instantly leave. We don't need the extra minute to rip our hair out over. Especially the pause before the second alarm. Is there ANY genuine point for this to exist instead of even, I don't know, INSTANTLY telling that half of MacGregor to leave? Almost seems like there could be serious issues if a real fire spread far enough to box people in while they were waiting to see if the alarm sounds for them.

#20534 I've had had serious moments of depression every semester I've been here. Usually it's related to some toxic relationship I've been in, but this semester, I'm in a pretty great relationship.
However, I'm going back into my depression cycle without an obvious thing I can point to as "the reason." My boyfriend thinks that my workload is too much, so I've thought of that being the possibility, but tbh, I like all my classes this semester and enjoy my time in all of them. ...

#20524 Today in 6.08 my lab partner was so kind and patient with me. I was having a rough morning and was seriously struggling to understand the lab but they were so nice about it and helped me learn the material. They clearly knew what they were doing and could have easily finished like a half hour early and ditched but they didn't and their kindness really brightened my day! Thank you to that person and I hope this post can spread some positivity.

#20522 Did you ever hear the tragedy of fructose the ketone-containing monosaccharide?
'No'
I thought not. It's not a story the corn industry would tell you. It's a low-carb legend. Fructose was a ketose so powerful and so wise, it could use biochemistry to influence the liver's mitochondria to create ... lipids. It had such a knowledge of metabolism, it could even keep the ones who ate it ... from being healthy. ...

#20515 To the person in 18.102 that constantly squeezes their water bottle and squirts out water:
PLEASE STOP!
The sound that this makes is VERY, VERY DISGUSTING and annoying! It is very easy to drink water without distracting the entire classroom. I am sitting in the opposite side of the room and I can still hear you. I am sure that I am not the only one that is annoyed because I see other people staring at you whenever you do it. 
I know it probably bothers me more than it should, but please stop.

#20497 I was in the Banana Lounge at like 12:30am and I'm pretty sure I saw a group of people walk in and take an entire box of bananas. What the fuck? I feel like this sort of behavior could lead us to losing this type of thing. Also, that is just plain abusive. I'm pretty sure I recognized one of them and know their name. If people are pissed enough at this, I'll call them out lol. Otherwise I'll assume I'm just overreacting.

#20493 PSA: Reasons why men wear shorts in the winter:
1. It’s convenient. 
2. Lots of pockets to store various odds and ends in. 
3. Sometimes they’re your most comfortable piece of clothing
Basically it’s safe, quick, and easy and everyone should try this at least once in their lifetimes, lest you regret it later. Eom.

#20490 Sometimes I wish I never came here. I had to adapt to this place while dealing with an eating phobia; literally being afraid to swallow fucking food. Life was terrible. But I'm happy to say that I'm getting over it. I think that it was a problem that stemmed from caring too much about what others thought of me. I would eat alone because of the anxiety, and I'm sorry to all the potential friends I alienated. Not giving a fuck has given me a sense of agency, and is making everything better. (Not sharing for pity, just feels therapeutic)

#20481 The guy I’m currently dating has an ex-girlfriend who is so much smarter than me, and I feel like I have to always prove myself or pretend to be smarter than I actually am. Plus, I feel like if he had the chance, he’d go back to her. I can’t tell if my insecurities are legitimate or if I’m just lacking confidence.

#20446 Man I feel so bad when the lecturer has to shout over everyone packing up and all the desks squeaking. It's a tragedy of the commons thing where one person doesn't add anything so it doesn't make sense for any one person to be quiet, but still I just feel like the professor is trying to tie up his lecture and it's a matter of a few minutes, plus it's hard to get your material just right cause it's not like you want to end your lecture early either. But then everyone starts squeaking and wants to leave. Especially sucks when the lecturer says "so the main thing from this lecture" or "if you take away one thing from today, just remember" but he can't finish his sentence cause the hustle is already bustling...

Zachary Pitcher I've felt this way before, but then again I've had classes where the professor would run into the next hour before finishing up, and would give vital information in those last 5 minutes. Like, I have other classes man

#20434 To everyone out there that just “knows” no one likes them, I’d like to tell you that maybe you’re wrong, that maybe you’re the person that I can’t admit my feelings for because I’m afraid it’ll ruin the friend group, or maybe you’re the person I steal a glance at in recitation just hoping one day you’ll sit by me, or maybe you’re that cutie studying in the library that keeps distracting me from my psets. No matter who you are, just remember that maybe there’s someone that thinks you’re great, and you just don’t realize it.

June Kim
June Kim Consider talking to her about what might be behind her suicidal ideation. Then talk to her about getting professional help. Offer to go to MIT mental health together so she has more support. I personally felt like staying at a hospital caused more trauma than good for me, so sending someone to a hospital without really knowing the situation is not a good idea.

Ahmed Mahmoud Unless you're a trained counselor and are very sure you can help, it's best that you speak to professionals. The stakes are too high. Also, if they're not too far, you need to get there in person or get someone you know to head over there. Like right now.

#20415 A Sport is basically just anything competitive that involves yeeting something.
Football? Soccer? Basketball? Baseball? Tennis? Water Polo? Golf? Volleyball? Badminton? They literally are all just various forms of yeeting something, usually a ball.
Based on this definition, consider cheerleading. People often debate if it's a sport? I conclude that it is indeed a sport because it involves yeeting other people.

#20400 I've barely decided where I'm moving post graduation and my mom is already nagging me about buying a house for them to move into and to make me look like I got my shit together so that girls can like me.
Because nothing's more attractive than a 22 year old who's broke (after buying a 
whole fucking house) and lives with his parents #asianLogic

#20399 Dear L,
You might not see this since you barely check MIT confession but here goes. I am really thankful to know you. You never fail to surprise me every day with all those little things, including "how are you?", "you got this", and ":)". They really made me feel better when times are tough. And even though you always say that you are a horrible person, your kindness and thoughtfulness prove otherwise. So if you are sad, let me know, chocolate will be there for you. You got this, L:)
Your caffeine.

#20386 People here can't recycle for shit smh. Educate yourselves. I cringe every time I look into the course 6 lounge's trash (among others). The worst are those who actually think they know what can be recycled.
And this is MIT, where people are supposedly very smart and stuff. It's so depressing. Also recycling here is managed so that it's SO SIMPLE people, what the FUCK is wrong with you. Such an easy way to help the environment.

Sergio Marroquin Thanks for the resource but recycling is a shitshow. Don't just tout it off as EaSy and shrug off the fact that it's extremely nuanced.

For example, you can't recycle coffee cups, plastic bags, straws, pizza boxes, paper towels, wet paper, etc.…See More

MIT Confessions Perhaps situational was not the best word, we're talking about posts relating to things such as housing. Thank you for asking!

MIT Confessions No, we just believe that there are other places for the political discourse that's been happening here. There are plenty of Facebook pages, an MIT subreddit, or etc. to continue those discussions. That being said, how we go about this change will be a work in progress, if you have any complaints of how things are going, please feel free to message us.

Chad Qian If we're talking about freedom, then, as a private party, MIT Confessions has the freedom to decide which confessions to post, and which confessions to not post.

If you don't like it, go somewhere else (like MIT Political Confessions or a political subreddit) or create your own page.
