All my other friends' boyfriends pay for their dates etc or alternate. We just charge each other for everything. He's financially stable so that isn't the issue either. I would also like to treat him out sometimes. My ex would try and spoil me, and I'd decline, but now I miss that. (not my ex, but the feeling of someone caring enough to spoil you). On the other hand, I am very aware that this sounds petty/shallow, and I hate that too."
02/22/2019 14:00:00, "I wish I hadn't been so trusting with my ex-girlfriend; we broke up after her friend told me that she had hooked up with and some guy at a frat party earlier this semester."Looking back, I can see where things went wrong with us. I'm not in Greek life, but she was in a sorority, and she'd never tell me that she was going out to parties unless her friends would mention it. She could tell I hated greek life, and that I didn't like when she'd go out with her single friend...See More
02/22/2019 12:30:00, "I am a high school senior and I got accepted into cal early with honors. I absolutely hate this school but going here makes the most sense (since i am interested in cs+business, cheap public school, close to home, in state tuition). I hate myself for thinking this but one of the main reasons I want to go here is because of Berkeley goggles. I live in the Bay area, and I am the "type" here‚Äîpretty, small asian girl. This is kinda embarrassing to say but I am known for being extremely gorgeous, smart, and sociable. Again, I hate to say this but i really don't want to give that up....... I got into UPENN Wharton and MIT early and those are great schools and all but.... I won't be considered stereotypically "pretty" there. I know how stupid of a reason it is but i can't help myself for thinking about it."
02/22/2019 11:00:00, "Every time I try to smoke pot on campus, campus safety or UCPD spontaneously appear from around a corner."I'd think they have like cameras around and are watching ready to pounce except that on numerous occasions I've found groups of people to be passing a joint around anywhere from in front of Dwinelle to Memorial Glade or even by VLSB.Is there some secret I am missing? I just want to get high in peace.
02/22/2019 09:30:00, "I like this guy, I have been seeing him for a couple semesters but he is not out. I really want him to have the time and space to come out on his own terms but honestly I do not think that my mental health can keep this up. I went through this and I am going back into my depression episodes and honestly I do not know what to do when I have to keep everything a secret and not touch him in public or anything like that because he does not want anyone to think he is a gay."
02/22/2019 08:00:00, "During the summer, all I can think about was how great my life was going to be like coming to cal; I mean, how couldn‚Äôt I? I really believed that I worked so hard for so much of my life that I was finally getting what I deserved. One thing I didn‚Äôt anticipate, however, was how lonely I was going to feel."I had such a great group of friends in high school, that before leaving I really almost took them for granted. I always felt like I was easy to get along with, always ...See More
02/21/2019 21:30:00, "to whoever was playing "always with me" from spirited away on the carillon bells: thank you for your beautiful performance! i happened to be walking up campanile way right as the song started, and the full view of the tower lit up against the night sky playing music from my childhood was really striking and surreal. i didn't want it to end. i hope you'll play some more ghibli songs on there someday - there are definitely people listening :)"
02/21/2019 20:00:00, "The guy who takes graduation pics for the yearbook was really cool and friendly. I know this isn't a juicy confession or whuteva, but it was fun talking to him! I haven't cross paths with a lot of people from Cal who reference memes, horoscope signs, or quote vines. I need more meme queens in my life. I wish I could be his homie, but I mean who really socializes outside of their circles at Cal yunno?? What am I going to do? Ask him to hang out? People don't do that. Everyone‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîgot too much shit on their plates to hang out with people if it's not convenient. Ugh dude like, I didn't even get to catch his name‚Äîwhich makes me a little sad because I got this friend crush on him. Oh whale I guess, I wish him the best because he's a dope dude."
02/21/2019 18:30:00, "I‚Äôm a straight girl and sometimes I wish I liked girls. I feel like it would be easier for me to date girls than to date guys. Sometimes I look at my best female friends and think how much I love them, but I can only love them as friends without romantic feelings."
02/21/2019 17:52:00, ". Does this page only post confessions regarding sex and love? How about confessions regarding ways you cheated to get an A in the class, or how you love Avatar the Last Airbender but too afraid to tell anyone because judgement sucks. I'm curious lol."
02/21/2019 17:00:00, "another holiday/gift-giving occasion, another gift of a cheap box of assortment chocolates from my manz. i love this boy to death and his cards are always so sweet, but omg somebody please tell him that no self-respecting girlfriend wants those shitty low-tier chocolates with like fuken dark chocolate raspberry almond nougat whatever. i rly do appreciate the thought (<3) but if ur gonna hit me with chocolates at least get me something actually edible like FERRERO ROCHERS or GHIRARDELLI SQUARES or omfg even some CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES but pls no more of the unbranded assortments :( still love you tho!"
02/21/2019 15:30:00, "I am off this semester because of a family emergency, but things are looking up. My mother is healing, and my friends have kept in contact despite how busy physics apparently is (engineering really be killing us). I can‚Äôt wait to see them next semester and begin making more memories. Love you guys :)"

02/21/2019 12:30:00, "tldr: not getting into haas isn't the end of the world. i hope this comforts even just one person today."In a couple of hours, Haas decisions will come out. Exactly 4 years ago, I eagerly waited for a decision that I thought mattered more than it really did. I was devastated when I didn't get in and even considered moving to my home state to lower my student loans. For a long time, I was bitter about Haas. I withdrew myself from my business frat, bad mouthed people who...See More

In fact, she's one of the best things that has happened to me in the past year. There's one thing though. When I'm talking to her, it's like I'm stepping on eggshells. We both care for each other so much to the point that we don't really say what's on our minds. I try my best to make her happy and I'm willing to place her needs above mine, but I feel like as..."See More

02/21/2019 08:00:00, "Going to the Museum of Ice Cream is some basic ass, white girl shit. Like I have seen the same few pictures on my feed, it makes feel like some of you girls are the same with no personality. Like live a little, be different, maybe post a picture of you doing a line of coke, that would be hotter to me."
02/20/2019 21:30:00, "I truely, truely wish the confessions admins secretly knew who sent in the confessions, because then they could out all of the absolutely horrid people at once someday who use anonymity to be a pos. Sure, it would destroy this page because no one would want to submit anymore, but it‚Äôd be completely worth it to ruin some of these people‚Äôs lives. If they‚Äôre gonna act like garbage, then they should be treated as garbage and embarrassed into hiding."This was written specifically as a reaction to the guy who plans to vote for trump again, but it‚Äôs definitey targeted at many of the posts in the last few months where people have just been awful human beings.
02/20/2019 20:00:00, "In my R1B class today, we were talking about our attitudes towards Valentine's Day, and this one girl said how it reminded her she was gonna die alone so she hated it. I'm already in a relationship, but I just have to say that you're really cute and nice, and you're not going to have any problem finding your dream SO. Good luck, and I hope your next valentine's day is better :)"
02/20/2019 18:30:00, "TLDR: Major in Media Studies"As someone who with a lot of friends at Cal, I always find it hilarious that the culture of this school looks down on humanities majors and glorifies STEM, especially engineering. I go to a liberal arts school in the northeast where the culture is the exact opposite. At schools like mine, the humanities are glorified and STEM majors are generally excluded from the social scene and largely shunned on campus. I was reading a confessio...Continue Reading
02/20/2019 17:00:00, "I have this friend. I'm not particularly romantically attracted to him--or even sexually attracted to him--but for some reason I really want to suck his dick. I know for a fact that he would be down and I haven't seen it or anything but I feel like this experience would be a really good for the both of us. Moreover I fantasize about him paying me to do it. I don't know how to ask for this in a respectful, not-awkward way. How much do I request? Would most guys even consider paying for that?"
02/20/2019 15:30:00, "there‚Äôs an asian girl on campus who im pretty sure is gay/queer and i see her around on campus all the time!! she always wears a dope ass windbreaker w her hair up and she looks super cool but im too shy to talk to her - but seeing her on campus literally makes me so happy and i feel butterflies heh like once i saw her outside rsf and WOW! never saw someone as cute as i have before"
