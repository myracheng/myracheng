I'm in my third year and I'm taking more physics classes than I am bio classes. It's like if you're a biz admin major but you spend 2/3 of your time studying social ecology.

Just today, I saw this guy get done with his workout and left 4 dumbbells on the ground where people walk. Like wtf? Put your shit back so others have the convenience of grabbing their dumbbells when they work out. Were you not taught manners when you were growing up? When you were little, did you just leave your toys out when you were done playing with them?"Idiots.

He genuine, wise, and funny. He look young but he's actually very mature and older. He always look at me in the eyes when he talks to me. His voice is so deep and soothing. He makes me change the perspective of life and how I look at myself. For the first time in my life, I want to open my heart to someone. But he has a girlfriend (4 years together) and he loves her very much. Every time we together, I just want to scream out that I love him, but I don't want ruin his relationship because part of me want him to be happy. I feel the pain was too great to be around him so I slowly distance away from him."He was my first love.

This was a first for me to stay on campus instead of going home for this long. I hate to say this but it’s not the most pleasant thing coming home because my family is very conservative and open about those views, while I am not. I talked with her about financial problems and it just hit me all of a sudden how my mom looked like she really missed me. I have been telling her I’m planning on staying over spring break and possibly summer break and I think she’s feeling lonely that I’m suddenly detaching myself from family time during breaks. It hurts my heart. So now I’m planning on going home for the weekend. Love your parents y’alls. You never know how much time they have left"
