How an anonymous Facebook post sparked a conversation about sexual violence in UC Berkeley tech clubs
Three weeks ago, a UC Berkeley student wrote an anonymous post on Facebook alleging that they were sexually assaulted at a retreat for a campus tech club, sparking a larger conversation about sexual assault and consent in campus coding and engineering groups.

1817. I feel bad because I kind of lurk in the comments whenever there's a wlw confession. I'm not completely closeted, but there's a decent amount of people I know here from home and I'm not ready for my family to find out yet. I just comb through for girls who seem single and are into girls too and hope I run into them on campus or in class.

1816. OK I had to get this off my chest...
I'm in 61b right now, and I love Hug. Great guy, super clear lecturer, very fair exams, well-structured class, etc.
But GOD DAMN why does he made that tongue-hitting-roof-of-mouth "CHUP" sound every five seconds in his lecture videos it drives me crazy. Pls stop.

1815. I know that politics affects everyday life and that people are trying to stand up for what they think is right. However, our school is always so stigmatized by the media for political things instead of its educational value-- the name doesn't make you think "wow much intellectual," instead it's "monkas politics!!!" Often involving people who aren't UC Berkeley students. The majority of us, I think, are just nerdy memelords. Recently, I don't feel as proud saying I go to UC Berkeley because all people will ask me about is about violence/politics instead of our rigorous academics. I just wish people would stop generalizing everyone in our entire school with politics, even though our university is a hotspot. This comes from a place of privilege, I admit, I just... don't want my job applications outside CA to be looked at with a snide impression.

1814. I just want to say that the grading rubric for the first Chem 4A midterm is hella fucked up. I got pretty much all my computations correct and included units in the beginning and final steps, but the rubric chooses to fuck you over just because you didn't rewrite the units you already wrote in every single intermediate step. This is one of the reasons why people hate the College of Chemistry. They try to dock you over really petty shit like units, when they should reall...

1813. I swear the most intimate experiences I've ever had here at Berkeley are when I lock eyes with the proctoring TAs during midterms. So much sexual tension you can cut it with a knife.

1812. I feel like I'm a pretty cheerful person and most of my friends probably don't know or realize the extent of the depression I've felt in my life but at nights like this its so fucking hard to keep going. I really fantasize a lot about returning to self harm but I don't want to have to explain to people what the marks are and it wouldn't be fair to the people wh ocare about me even if it would help in the moment. I just feel like I'm never fucking good enough. I really t...

1810. I was having a rough night tonight. Not even because of anything bad happening to me, I just felt down for no good reason. Regular loneliness I guess. I'm not really friends with my new roommate so I feel trapped when I go home. It's like I'm alone without the freedom of being alone.
Anyway, I missed my bus because I had to grab food, so I was just standing there at the stop, quietly singing to some music. I sit down on the 51B and across from me is some cute girl listening to something on her headphones. She really smiled at something she heard, and I don't know, it just really made me feel better somehow. I'll probably never see her again, but if she recognizes this post (it was like 9:30ish on a Thursday), I hope she knows she made my night.

1808. I’ve been stalking my CS70 TA like crazy. I’m sorry I just can’t stop and I don’t know what to do. After discussion section, I wait around and follow her to wherever she goes. I know where she lives, who some of her friends are, who her boyfriend is. I go to her OH without any questions, I just want to listen to her talk and explain and be super cute. She’s literally just so sweet and attractive I die in section every time. She’s major heart eyes and I can’t get enough of her, like I can’t believe someone can be so cute and smart at the same time. I stalk her on Facebook but she recently either blocked me or deleted it and I’m so sad because I can’t look at her pictures anymore :( I didn’t save any pictures so idk what to do.

1805. My girlfriend has terrible taste in music. She sometimes make me listen to it and I just say stuff like "yeah it is great." Half of the singers can't even sing. However, every time she overhears my music, she shits on it saying I have no taste in music. I wasn't even trying to show you my playlist... you just walked in or see my playlist on my phone and then say shit about it. I don't say anything about your playlist despite how terrible it is. I'm not trying to compete with you on who has better taste here. I just want to mind my own business and listen to my own music while working.

1804. It’s 2:22 (2/21) in the RSF. I just got called out in the women’s locker room for not sorting my trash correctly and tossing food in the bottle/can bin. Hey lady, please don’t judge me. You’re totally right! I only do that here because our janitors dump EVERYTHING in that gray bin they shuttle around, so there’s no point.
But since you care, you should probably complain to the admins of rec & sports - though I have a feeling they know and don’t care. 🤷🏻‍♀️

In fact, she's one of the best things that has happened to me in my entire life. There's one thing though. Every time I talk with her, I'm basically navigating a minefield. I'm deathly afraid of creeping her out so much to the point that I always have trouble saying anything detailed about how I feel. I try my best to make her feel co...

I guess with the recent trauma I've gone through in my life, I grew nostalgic for the past.
I'm finishing up my time at my uni, and I know that you recently transferred to Berkeley, and I just hope you're thriving, and I hope you're happy. Gods, this is dramatic. Knowing you, you'd probably be really uncomfortable right now. 😂Well, I g...

Makes my pussy wet af when I see a little white girl rocking Gucci Aces and off-white Ts. Makes me want to scissor with them on the spot.

1800. I spent some 8-ish hours on this week’s 61A homework, and I’m exhilirated when I finally finished it. Many people breezed thru this one, so once again I know I’m stupid - but who cares, I finished the homework on time, and I can’t be happier about it. Being stupid in this school is tough, but even stupid people like me should have the right to feel happy(at least occasionally). But honestly though... The hardest part about being stupid is trying to hide it. The fear that my friends will stop hanging out with me once they find out I’m stupid haunts me every day. Sometimes I really wish I could be like the smart kids and stop feeling like subhuman around them. Anyway, subhumans are human-like and at least partially valuable. I guess being partially valuable is better than being Nothing At All.

1798. Alright, so I’m not even a Haas major, nor have I ever been pre-Haas, but I just wanted to say that the review system seems like bullshit. Not to say people in Greek life don’t deserve to get into Haas, but does anyone else find it a little alarming that a few sororities have had either 100% or almost 100% acceptance into Haas? When Haas has an overall acceptance rate of 33%, I just feel like something’s off here, especially when consulting clubs and other business orgs seem to have really low acceptance rates.

1797. It makes me so sad when people are rude to professors/GSIs. I understand if an individual educator is callous/racist/sadistic and you respond accordingly, but talking over people, obviously watching Youtube during discussion, making fun of a GSI's accent, etc. does not make you 'cool', it just looks like you have no class and no respect for those who are simply trying to help you. Shout-out to Prof Terry Buehler, btw, I'm really enjoying/understanding the lectures and I didn't even take physics in high school.

So I’ve been in an open relationship for the last month or so and at first I was really excited about it, especially after being in monogamous relationships for the last 3 years. I was excited to flirt and have that moment of sexual tension with a stranger and have some nice, consensual, casual sex. But boy has the table turned.

1794. In my R5B class today, we were talking about our attitudes towards Valentine's Day, and this one boy said how it reminded him about his vow to never fall in love with a girl after being "bullied, abused and demonized" by every girl he ever had a crush on. I'm in a relationship so frankly I don't give a shit, but I just have to say that YOU brought all this shit upon yourself, and it's definitely easier for YOU to come to terms with dying alone than to keep looking for an SO. Good luck, and I hope you don't whine as much next Valentine's Day.

Our first and foremost job is to be as helpful to students as possible, but the reality is that a majority of our "free time" is spent with undergraduates (when we teach sections). There's a few cases in my department where grad students have dated undergraduates, and there's not a strong departmental norm against it...but I'd also hate to ask an ex-stu...

Full disclosure, had an unashamed wank and felt a previously unknown sense of Cal pride. Go out there and rep the colors laddie. besides, everyone loves a good nude leak. #gobears

1788. I’m in Moffitt taking a nap in the napping room and this big guy comes next to me and takes the pod next to mine (ok it’s one of those metal thingys not the actual pods that you can adjust and play music from). At first he lies down and seems to go to sleep but then soon after he takes his shoes off. No big deal you might think, but dude, just a few seconds later I could smell his feet and it was so gross. The area around me smelled like rotten milk. This guy has to be ...

Josh Weinstein
Josh Weinstein Hey OP, please be considerate of this student and the struggles he might be going through. EECS projects require immense amounts of time and devotion, which can even rob students of the freedom to bathe and shower. The stench of his feet comes from his exhaustion and fatigue from coding, not narcissism or rudeness.

1787. So I have the hugest crush on my ace friend and nothing makes me happier than the idea of watching crappy sitcoms while eating pizza or cuddling in a toasty blanket with them on a rainy day while reading books and drinking hot cocoa.
I know that being aromantic and asexual are distinct, and maybe they'd be down for beer and boardgames in our jammies but I worry that as I am not ace myself, I don't know what I would do about the fact that in top of being a hopeless romantic I'm still a horny twenty-something and this is the prime time I have for participating in the good ol' hookup.

1786. lmao @these amateur kids who just happen to own a DSLR charging ~$90 an hour for their time: tha'ts a full time valuation of their time of $188,640 annual salary even factoring in vacation/weekend time working 40 hours a week like the fuck LOL, did your parents never teach you humility or what
to be fair its probably just the market price, so LMFAO WHAT THE FUCK LOL @anyone who fucking thinks that these are reasonable prices to be paying for people who've probably done 20 minutes of googling if that "how to take grad photos" and then try to rob you at literally 2x the equivalent hourly pay of an engineer or compsci or business major

Devan Mathur
Devan Mathur pretty sure the whole point IS that you can't be literally taking photographs 40 hours a week. Plus you're forgetting all the editing work, which can take even longer.

For someone who wants to be a smartass you really didn't think this through huh

1784. CW: Death of a student
I thought I saw you on campus today walking up the steps of MLK. But it hit me a second later that you are not actually here on this earth anymore. When you passed in October, I struggled to comprehend what was happening simply because I always thought I would be able to reach out to you and tell you how much I liked you the next time that I saw you.
Of course, that phrase "next time" is still haunting me to this very day. ...

1781. I just got off a call with my grandparents, in the middle of which I just stopped responding. They were talking about their health issues so nonchalantly, but I couldn't keep it together anymore and started to cry. I love my grandparents a lot--or I know they love me a lot, and I feel responsible for reciprocating that love, which I think I do? They were the ones who took care of me when I was little, but it's just been getting harder and harder to communicate with them...

1776. Hot take: International students from places like China should only be allowed to study here if they plan on immigrating here. I'm tired of all the Chinese students that come here and only socialize with other Chinese students, cheat off each other, and talk shit about the US. If you hate it so much here, don't use up resources which could have gone to more deserving domestic students.

1770. all my friends dislike my boyfriend because whenever we have a fight, I always go to my friends and I rarely talk about the good things he does. One of my best friends wanted me to break up with him and she had valid points, but I just can't. I do love him and part of me also doesn't want to be single again. I hated being single, i hate the hookup culture and I like the cuddling and wholesome activities that comes with a relationship. Sometimes I don't know if i'm with him because I want to be with him or I just want to be in a relationship, but I also get a pit in my stomach when I think about life without him. I don't really know what to do because he causes a lot of stress in my life but also keeps me sane (sort of a can't live with him but can't live without him situation)

I’m just going through the movements of school. of life. I’m wasting my parents hard-earned money. I’m wasting space in this school by not doing well. someone else could’ve gotten in instead of me. someone with aspirations and work ethic. bet this hellhole wants me out now and regrets ever accepting me. I would say I want to go home... but I don’t. I love my parents and my brother but it’s so stifling there. I have to be someone I’m not. I breathe a sigh of relief when I get back on campus but that relief is short lived as the wave of coursework makes me cry and tear my hair out.
I guess I’m just a little entitled whiny bitch anyway

My roommate and I use headphones to listen to music/watch videos in the room, and we're lucky enough to have a living room to take phone calls in. You don't have to suffer and she might not even know how you feel, best of luck!

1763. Every time I look at my last name, written, typed, or even hearing someone struggle to pronounce it, I'm reminded of the awful things my father has done to my family. A jolt of sadness overwhelms me every time I see it and it's been almost two years. I'm thinking of changing my last name to my mother's maiden name (which would strongly identify myself as a part of an exclusive tribal group), or to an English-ified version of my last name (take out three letters, my last name feels entirely freed of my father), or even both because I strongly identify with my mother's culture and my American upbringing and not my father's, as much as I've tried to be open. I'm willing to do anything to rid myself from his legacy, and I think it's the last thing I need to completely recover. I'm scared this will be frowned upon though. Thoughts?

Jonas Katona Ik some people in the units who used to put their stuff in the dryer, go have dinner or something with their friends, casually chill with them afterwards, and come back over 3 hrs later to get their clothes 😒Honestly, at that point, you deserve to have your clothes taken out, possibly more, because you willfully took your time

1760. I joined a new research lab a few weeks ago. I show up to the first lab meeting, and I realize: I'm in lab with my ex-girlfriend's new bf, my new gf's ex-boyfriend, my best friend's ex's new boyfriend, and my friend's TA crush.

1759. Sometimes it feels like the only way to avoid assault is by having a good boyfriend.
I’ve been single since I came to Cal (well, sorta. My longest Cal relationship was 6 months, so effectively single) and I’ve seen a lot. I was assaulted by my 61a project partner and solicited by enough homework group members freshman year that I did all my work (except my 61b projects, god bless my lovely best friend and female project partner; and 16b and 61c labs/projects due to my l...

I had a thing with a girl in my unit last semester where I’d come home too drunk to walk in a straight line, and she’d swing by and fuck me.
Suddenly she stopped taking advantage of me and I guess recently I kinda missed it... so I gave her a booty call.

1756. Sometimes I think that guys don't realize that girls are JUST as horny as they are. Every time I go to a frat party or any social outing with alpha males, I KNOW these guys would love nothing more than to have a girl suck them off!! But all of these non-frat boys or the nice guys are so afraid to ever make a move like cmon im soaked at this point and would love nothing more than to be in a room with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fucking pay attention!!!!!!! If u r a quiet shy boy please make your move already because she is probably into you as much as you are into her (this does not in anyway mean to be a freak: no means no. But just shoot your shot and if it doesn't work u got nothing to loose. Girls also wanna quick fuck too sometimes, just talk to her.!

1753. There's a girl I met in class this semester. I like her but I'm worried it's too early since we met to tell her, and I'm pretty bad at picking up when someone actually likes me so I'm not sure if she feels the same.
Well, we were joking about how she's later on the rolecall than someone else with her name in our class and the thought occured to me that if she took my last name she'd get to be called earlier. 
It was a random, weird, stupid-to-voice-aloud kinda thought. But at that same moment she asked me what my last name was.
Surely she couldn't have been thinking the same thing. How statistically unlikely is it that I would meet other people as awkward as myself?

Shane McDonald Nah dude just do you. It's fine to go at your own pace, some people just don't have super strong sex drives. As long as you're being honest with your partner upfront about your low sex drive and you're only doing things you're comfortable with, I think it'll be fine. Obviously you may have partners with higher sex drives but what's most important is doing only what you're comfortable with.

1743. Why do girls that aren't tall want a tall guy so bad? I find it kinda off-putting when a girl judges a guy for their height when they themselves wouldn't even be able to reach a shower head. They just look like children to me, especially if I wouldn't even see the top of their head when walking down Sproul. I get it for tall girls if they don't want to feel like they're dating a child, if they want a guy taller than them. But seriously, it's kind of disgusting when regular or short girls judge guys by their height when they're still shorter than the "short guy". I'm saying this as 6'3" dude at Cal, who's fed up with girls trying to climb me. Find someone your own size.

I’ve been trying to practice abstinence until I find a wholesome relationship, but it’s hard when I’m so horny and I just really wanna get dicked down 😔 at the same time, I know it won’t do it for me anymore. I really long for a stable, emotional connection.

JUST LOOK AT THE SYMMETRY OF PI LAMBDA PHI! I only want to good looking letter combination, not something like DKE, AEP or sigma ligma dugma. Like do people not consider the letter combination and how good it looks when rushing? I wonder if this is the case for sororities as well. We definitely need more houses with aesthetically-pleasing letter combinations.

1735. I love my boyfriend and we have an incredible relationship. He's one of my best friends and I am insanely grateful to have him in my life. He's there for me 100% of the time and goes above and beyond in terms of caring. One thing which bothers me, although it shouldn't, is that we charge each other for everything on venmo. All my other friends' boyfriends pay for their dates etc or alternate. We just charge each other for everything. He's financially stable so that isn't the issue either. I would also like to treat him out sometimes. My ex would try and spoil me, and I'd decline, but now I miss that. (not my ex, but the feeling of someone caring enough to spoil you). On the other hand, I am very aware that this sounds petty/shallow, and I hate that too.

Looking back, I can see where things went wrong with us. I'm not in Greek life, but she was in a sorority, and she'd never tell me that she was going out to parties unless her friends would mention it. She could tell I hated greek life, and that I didn't like when she'd go out with her single friend...

I hate myself for thinking this but one of the main reasons I want to go here is because of Berkeley goggles. I live in the Bay area, and I am the "type" here—pretty, small asian girl. This is kinda embarrassing to say but I am known for being extremely gorgeous, smart, and sociable. Again, I hate to say this but i really don't want to give that up....... I got into UPENN Wharton and MIT early and those are great schools and all but.... I won't be considered stereotypically "pretty" there. I know how stupid of a reason it is but i can't help myself for thinking about it.

1732. Every time I try to smoke pot on campus, campus safety or UCPD spontaneously appear from around a corner.
I'd think they have like cameras around and are watching ready to pounce except that on numerous occasions I've found groups of people to be passing a joint around anywhere from in front of Dwinelle to Memorial Glade or even by VLSB.
Is there some secret I am missing? I just want to get high in peace.

1731. I like this guy, I have been seeing him for a couple semesters but he is not out. I really want him to have the time and space to come out on his own terms but honestly I do not think that my mental health can keep this up. I went through this and I am going back into my depression episodes and honestly I do not know what to do when I have to keep everything a secret and not touch him in public or anything like that because he does not want anyone to think he is a gay.

1730. During the summer, all I can think about was how great my life was going to be like coming to cal; I mean, how couldn’t I? I really believed that I worked so hard for so much of my life that I was finally getting what I deserved. One thing I didn’t anticipate, however, was how lonely I was going to feel.
I had such a great group of friends in high school, that before leaving I really almost took them for granted. I always felt like I was easy to get along with, always ...

1729. to whoever was playing "always with me" from spirited away on the carillon bells: thank you for your beautiful performance! i happened to be walking up campanile way right as the song started, and the full view of the tower lit up against the night sky playing music from my childhood was really striking and surreal. i didn't want it to end. i hope you'll play some more ghibli songs on there someday - there are definitely people listening :)

1728. The guy who takes graduation pics for the yearbook was really cool and friendly. I know this isn't a juicy confession or whuteva, but it was fun talking to him! I haven't cross paths with a lot of people from Cal who reference memes, horoscope signs, or quote vines. I need more meme queens in my life. I wish I could be his homie, but I mean who really socializes outside of their circles at Cal yunno?? What am I going to do? Ask him to hang out? People don't do that. Everyone—including myself—got too much shit on their plates to hang out with people if it's not convenient. Ugh dude like, I didn't even get to catch his name—which makes me a little sad because I got this friend crush on him. Oh whale I guess, I wish him the best because he's a dope dude.

1727. I’m a straight girl and sometimes I wish I liked girls. I feel like it would be easier for me to date girls than to date guys. Sometimes I look at my best female friends and think how much I love them, but I can only love them as friends without romantic feelings.

Maddy Peterson OP I see where you’re coming from but maybe think a little harder about the adversity that queer women face every single day- like for example the paralyzing fear of coming out due to possible backlash from friends and family- and reconsider making comments like this. you’re speaking from a place of immense privilege and insisting that queer women have it “easier” is belittling and alienating.

1726.5. Does this page only post confessions regarding sex and love? How about confessions regarding ways you cheated to get an A in the class, or how you love Avatar the Last Airbender but too afraid to tell anyone because judgement sucks. I'm curious lol.

My mother is healing, and my friends have kept in contact despite how busy physics apparently is (engineering really be killing us). I can’t wait to see them next semester and begin making more memories. Love you guys :)

1723. tldr: not getting into haas isn't the end of the world. i hope this comforts even just one person today.
In a couple of hours, Haas decisions will come out. Exactly 4 years ago, I eagerly waited for a decision that I thought mattered more than it really did. I was devastated when I didn't get in and even considered moving to my home state to lower my student loans. For a long time, I was bitter about Haas. I withdrew myself from my business frat, bad mouthed people who...

There's one thing though. When I'm talking to her, it's like I'm stepping on eggshells. We both care for each other so much to the point that we don't really say what's on our minds. I try my best to make her happy and I'm willing to place her needs above mine, but I feel like as...

1720. Going to the Museum of Ice Cream is some basic ass, white girl shit. Like I have seen the same few pictures on my feed, it makes feel like some of you girls are the same with no personality. Like live a little, be different, maybe post a picture of you doing a line of coke, that would be hotter to me.

1719. I truely, truely wish the confessions admins secretly knew who sent in the confessions, because then they could out all of the absolutely horrid people at once someday who use anonymity to be a pos. Sure, it would destroy this page because no one would want to submit anymore, but it’d be completely worth it to ruin some of these people’s lives. If they’re gonna act like garbage, then they should be treated as garbage and embarrassed into hiding.
This was written specifically as a reaction to the guy who plans to vote for trump again, but it’s definitey targeted at many of the posts in the last few months where people have just been awful human beings.

1718. In my R1B class today, we were talking about our attitudes towards Valentine's Day, and this one girl said how it reminded her she was gonna die alone so she hated it. I'm already in a relationship, but I just have to say that you're really cute and nice, and you're not going to have any problem finding your dream SO. Good luck, and I hope your next valentine's day is better :)

1717. TLDR: Major in Media Studies
As someone who with a lot of friends at Cal, I always find it hilarious that the culture of this school looks down on humanities majors and glorifies STEM, especially engineering. I go to a liberal arts school in the northeast where the culture is the exact opposite. At schools like mine, the humanities are glorified and STEM majors are generally excluded from the social scene and largely shunned on campus. I was reading a confessio...

1716. I have this friend. I'm not particularly romantically attracted to him--or even sexually attracted to him--but for some reason I really want to suck his dick. I know for a fact that he would be down and I haven't seen it or anything but I feel like this experience would be a really good for the both of us. Moreover I fantasize about him paying me to do it. I don't know how to ask for this in a respectful, not-awkward way. How much do I request? Would most guys even consider paying for that?
