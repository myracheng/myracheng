14526) Breakup is difficult. It can be compared to the loss of a loved one. That's how painful it is. There's nothing wrong with you. To make the pain of the breakup easier to handle, No Contact/ Radio Silence helps. It's separating from your ex immediately post-breakup and going into a period of silence.
It is normal to feel like you're overwhelmed with emotions. The best way to ensure you bounce back quickly is to take actions. Be active. Go exercise. Push yourself to try s...

14521) I showed my BF an insta page of a girl who has a lot of followers for showing off her body and I was talking about how interesting it was to gain such a big following for that and that was the end of that convo but later that night he texted me asking for her page. I asked him why he wanted it and he said that he was just curious and that if I couldn’t find it then it was fine but i asked him if he was going to Jerk off to it and he kinda ignored it until I pressed on and he admitted to it. Is it wrong that i feel angry about this? Mostly the part where he asked me to give him her page. I’m okay with him watching porn because nearly everyone watches it but I just found myself feeling gross about it even when I brought it up to him. I think it’s just the fact of him asking me to send him jerk off material is not okay in my book.

14508) I feel like I have nothing in common with most other people in ICS. I'm fairly girly, I don't game or have extensive experience with coding (I got into it late in high school), I enjoy the arts and humanities, and I have a fairly loud personality. It kind of sucks not having someone to bond with in my classes. Please, someone from ICS prove me wrong, I'd like to make friends similar to me in my major!

Diellza Sopi You should check out WICS if you haven't already! We have a lot of diversity in the group and I think you'll find more than a few people who you'll have similarities with
I'm also a CS major who enjoys arts/humanities and actually started coding freshman year (I do like games, tho i dont really 'game'), so there's more of us out there than you think haha

14507) To all my people fighting depression and anxiety: y’all ever feel like giving up ? I feel like I can’t live this way anymore but there’s always something pushing me to go on. Lost in my own thoughts, sometimes I really question my existence but like I mentioned there’s something so little pushing me to move on and not gun it. I know I’m not the only one who feels like this but it’s hard. I can’t even speak to a therapist or psychiatrist because they will label me “insane”. confused and scared.

Daniel Mckenzie Some of this is natural because relationships tend to go through a honeymoon period in which the first couple months will be perfect but then you start getting bothered by the little things. But how you can tell if you really love him is if you can still love him with all his little flaws (and vice versa)

14491) For the longest time I didn't know you're just supposed to wipe your ass. I'd stick my finger with toilet paper up my rectum until it was dry and nothing appeared on the toilet paper except maybe a bit of blood. I don't get turned on by it or anything (I'm a straight male). I just don't feel completely clean unless I can stick something up my butt without it coming out all dirty. Maybe it's an OCD thing? Also, doesn't wiping make you feel like you're just spreading shit everywhere?

14487) How can girls zoot their zot? I think this guy in my discussion is really cute but we haven't even had a conversation, like we literally haven't said anything to each other aside from asking what the answer to the last question was. I see him occasionally before lecture, but mostly just in discussion. We're approaching Week 8, so I only really have a couple more chances to make it happen. How do I bring up a conversation of potentially studying together without it being weird or creepy (not sure he'd even recognize me from discussion)? Pls help I'm in desperate need of advice 😩

14486) I have depression, and when I argue with myself over whether or not I should commit suicide, there's one question that always sticks out in my mind:
Is suicide a function of natural selection to get rid of more emotionally "weak" individuals?
Thankfully, every time I've tried to kill myself, something's come up to prevent it from happening. I really don't want to hurt my loved ones, but sometimes arguments like the above just seem too logical....

Tony Yun
Tony Yun Over 90 percent of people who commit suicide had a diagnosable mental illness. With this being said, if someone had cancer would they be labeled as “weak”? No. It’s something they didn’t choose, same thing with your depression. Don’t ever call yourself weak mate, you being here and alive means you’re a strong individual.

They never got in anyone’s face or yelled or chanted, just stood there silently, respectfully asking if you wanted a brochure. A PUBLIC university is not a place to only approve and front a single viewpoint and therefore, those folks had every right to do what they did. They weren’t trying to convince you to become pro-li...

14480) I'm so tired of my hall friends. I'm literally always there for them but they rarely have mine. Whenever they're sad I try my best to cheer them up and be there for them. I stayed up 6 hours more than I wanted to when my roommate got broken up with and she didn't wanna be alone but would never get the same. Today I was put in a situation that triggered a memory of me being nearly human trafficked as a kid and felt so alone. I'm glad to have joined a club because the friends I've made have been so warm and welcoming. The rest can smd.

14475) @13956) Felt the same way as you and experienced this when I went through SPOP. Felt more excluded around the majority of staffers who preached about inclusivity but didn’t act on it except within their own friend group and the more “popular” cliques. Hope the upcoming SPOP staffers this year work on changing that and evaluating their own “inclusive” behaviors around their fellow staffers and others.

I’m sure he would be pleasantly surprised if you approached and just introduced yourself. If it’s a discussion, maybe try sitting close to him and asking him a question or two about what’s going on in class as well? Good luck!

14449) Honestly, I agree with confession #14103. Being a STEM major is honestly way harder than any social science majors. To the comments that said it's about simple internalization and application - it's not. All STEM fields are innovating so rapidly, in order to keep up students are expected to do very abstract, out of the box thinking. It's not just memorization - it's trying to force your brain to think in such unexpected ways all for the sake of trying to help people in...

Daniel Mckenzie I mean I understand as a poly sci major and someone who clearly knows politics. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if their opinion is wrong or horrible. Apart of studying politics is realizing most people don’t know shit about politics and have very uniformed opinions

14437) People at this school are so fucking close minded. If they don’t agree with your political beliefs they automatically hate you or fear you or some other stupid shit. I realize it’s California but not everyone is a Democrat. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t mean they don’t deserve your respect. Also, y’all are sensitive babies over the abortion posters (pun intended).

14430) Hey, thanks to the guy who carried my binder for 2 whole years in high school. He'd get really mad when I said that I'm okay with carrying it, then hold the binder in his right hand and hold my hand with his left hand. He'd walk me to class even though it'd be far away from my own. Now in college, he doesn't carry my binder anymore because laptops and we're in different majors so we can't walk each other to class...
But ayy, he lives in Caballo and I'm in Playa so we're basically tower neighbors >:) Thanks for being in my life and continuing to be there in the future. <3

14429) I have mixed feelings about my scars. I wish they weren’t there so I could wear other clothes without checking if they’re peeking all the time, but some fucked up part of me wants to keep them there and add more. I don’t even have a lot or bad ones but it still bothers me. I’m insecure about dating, getting intimate, changing in front of people, and hell even swimming and I hate it. I should buy a scar fader and use that but I feel like that won’t matter once my fucked up side decides to just put them back.

14428) Fun fact ASUCI wastes our money and is corrupt as hell. They are out here buying hundred dollar jackets with our money instead of actually paying for things that go back to us. They take the leftover money at the end of the year and spend it buying everyone a hydro flask saying "well it'll just go to waste otherwise". Maybe you should fucking spend it on us or give us that part of our tuition money back you corrupt fucks.

14424) Sometimes I wonder why I do this to myself. Why I am juggling 20 units to turn in assignments late, to believe that I am 25 words from success. Why I am so willing to push the limits of my schedule and my sanity on something I have no particular interest in. I am not saying I hate writing. In fact, I agree that it’s necessary to develop the skill to write and argue. My problem is that I cannot argue for or against what I do not have any interest in, such as humanities....

14420) College life gives me so much anxiety and stress. I’m not as outgoing so it’s very hard for me to be apart of clubs because everyone socializes and I just suck at that. Then there’s the worry of grades. Throughout high school only getting decent grades helped me go to college. I feel like if that’s gone then I’m just useless.

I’m not sure what went wrong but I thought this guy kinda had a thing for me I saw him looking at my from the side of his eye, we walked to our cars one time and little stuff like that. So I thought I had a chance and I texted him Friday night and he never replied. I’m so sad because he’s my partner for the rest of the school session so things are going to be awkward as FUCK now. 
Also I’m 21, I don’t know why I only attract guys who are between the ages of 29-35!!! I never had a single guy my age attracted to me. I’m so sad 😞

Whenever I tell someone I’m a bio major they either roll their eyes in the “Oh ANOTHER Bio major at this school” way or they cringe at me and be like “you must be dying good luck haha” but when someone else is like “I’m a [anything but Bio major],” people become interested and more inclined to have a conversation. It’s so fucking annoying 😤

14411) I fell for my best friend and my feelings weren’t reciprocated. Over the last couple of weeks I thought I’d grown to move on, but the feelings just keep hammering back. I promised I wouldn’t distance myself, but I feel like I have no other choice. Sometimes I feel like crying when I look at him because he feels so close, yet so far away. I try to be happy for him, but my selfishness is killing me.

Honestly, man, I feel you. I feel like non-STEM majors on this campus live on a completely different planet. I mean, taking 2 unit classes that are worth 8 units of work? Spending 2/3 of your degree working in OTHER fields that are not what you intended to study? Like, I'm a bio major. But I've taken more chem classes than I have bio classes. I'm in my third year and I'm taking more physics classes than I am bio classes. It's like if you're a biz admin major but you spend 2/3 of your time studying social ecology. I don't think other students quite understand that and it's. a. god. damn. struggle.

He has never done anything fucked up to me or has hurt me on a significant way. I feel like my friends are constantly blowing me off and don’t really care about me and that shit hurts, but my boyfriend has never made me feel like that. People always think friends are more important that boyfriends/girlfriends, but I completely disagree. Anyone who make you feel loved is the best type of friend.

14408) I feel that my parents are dragging me down. They are always fighting and they act like children. They drag me i to their problems and my anxiety is through the roof. I cant move out so idk what to do. I really just wanna move out and take my siblings with me. I’m tired of having to act like a parent to my parents.

Vincent Khao You really have to stand up against your parents. If they are dragging you down you have to put that foot down and tell them you're tired of their shit. They're parents and they should act like proper ones

14405) I have a crush on this dude from one of my clubs, but I’m not going to do anything about it because I feel like I’ll never be good enough for him 😞 Tons of people from the club also thinks he’s cute but I’m barely average compared to all the girls in the club or even in the whole school tbh 😔 And I know some of your guy’s comments will try to encourage me or give me advice but it’s okay. Save your hands from typing. I’m not really looking for advice or anything, I just wanted to get this off my chest. He’s just really cute and just amazing overall and although I won’t confess, I do hope he ends up with a girl who is good enough for him.

Armen Mouradyan
Armen Mouradyan I ain't gonna be saving these hands. How do you know that he won't be interested in you? Tons of girls might like him but if he's still single, that means he probably isn't into them. Imagine finding out you could have had something if you had just gone for it. The regret from that is much worse than dealing with the anxiety of the moment.

14398) So I saw this confession:
13802) I'm not sure if my girlfriend is done chasing other guys yet, and it fucking hurts. She always comments on how hot other guys are, and I see her actively flirting with them on social media. Just wish I could be better for her tbh maybe I wouldn't feel as insecure about my body.
...and there was very little response. No anger or anything, just people telling him to communicate with her more....

I’m kinda clueless when it comes to signs so is there anything obvious that I can look out for? Also how do you shoot your shot casually/smoothly?? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated 😀

14396) You say you love me, but did you really if you still redeveloped feelings for her? Sure you two had history, but we have been together for over 2 years already and you two had broken up a while back. My self esteem has took a dive and I still can’t believe what you have done. I’m trying to learn to forgive you for emotionally cheating, but it’s difficult. I don’t feel like I was a second choice, but it sucks knowing I wasn’t the only one in your heart.

I have this one friend whom I can click with so well... but whenever we don’t see each other for a looong time it gets really tensed (???) then we always have a weird nevative vibe going on. I hate it ugh why cant we just be normal like nothings happened? Im just so tired of having to drive all the freaking time whenever we hang out. It’s also so weird that everytime we want to hang out, it’s the worst timing ever. Idk how to confront my friend :/ about driving & busy bc i have to study. Like i want to give time obviously but it’s not like im the only busy one? Im pretty sure my friend is suuper busy too. Man i wish confrontation was just easier.

14389) I say I want to be in a relationship but I think I’ll just fuck it up. I see all the happy couples and I wonder if I could be one of them. 
First impossibility: guys I meet don’t like me. They are always attracted to my friends because I act too much like a dude sometimes and I don’t put in enough effort to look nice( entirely my fault). 
Second impossibility;: I’m hella insecure and things my partner does would affect me so much. ( again, my fault)
Maybe too broken for this shit

I'm not motivated to make myself a better person anymore, I go through bursts and attempts of trying to make myself someone I can be proud of but then I just realize I can never compare to others. I don't have what it takes to succeed in this world because I have a weak mentality. I'm just really tired... really really tired... I really don't know if I can take more of this...

Sometimes I watch a drama or dance shows or go through the galleries or go to music recitals and think this is amazing why don't more people come to these things? I love making art for my community but sometimes it feels like the people I'm trying to reach don't come out and I'm just preaching to the choir. I want my art to mean something but I feel like it's trapped in this little Claire Trevor island.

14373) Tbh I don't think I've ever felt more lonely than I do now. I became roommates with people who I considered good friends. But now, only one talks to me, the other practically doesn't live here anymore, the last one has been mad at me for months for something I dont even know about and refuses to talk to me. I always try to be a nice person, especially to those I considered close friends. I used to hang out with them all the time last year and we had a lot of good times. Now theyre all in one room having fun and I'm in my own room wondering where I went wrong. I really don't have any friends here anymore. The few I do have left are busy with their own lives. Sometimes it just feels like they are super loud just to make me mad and show off that theyre better off without me.

Kit Ma @OP The more you think that you're better without them is the main reason why you're not being a good friend. Have some more self-confidence and self love for yourself before you open up with others. If you're not treating yourself right then you're no…See More

14371) I used to have a crush on my boyfriends friend before we became a couple. Im happy in our relationship right now, but whenever I see the friend I cant help but wonder what we wouldve been like together or get jealous when i see him with other girls. the friend and I were friends way before I met my boyfriend. I dont know what to do.

14366) I've been dating this great girl for a few months and recently she bought me plane tickets to go to Europe with her. Unfortunately I just got out of a long relationship and before this one and underestimated my readiness and patience for another one. She's been amazing, however I'm a person who gets annoyed when others aren't punctual or give a heads up if they'll be late; something she's unfortunately bad at.
This is a definite deal breaker for me. And after all of the late mishaps, I think I'm just going to end it so that she can take a family member with her. Any tips on being more patient? This is my one major pet peeve and it's been a hurdle to get over.

Micah Rutrough I've never had major body image issues, so i don't know the extent that this applies to your situation, but one little trick that helped me is to try to replace knee-jerk self deprication ("i look like garbage") with sarcastic self-aggrandizement ("i am the most attractive human alive"). It's weird, but just saying the words does help you believe them after a while, even if it started as a joke.

14352) My boyfriend and I went out drinking last night and I got fucked up. When we got back home, we got into bed and starting having some sloppy sexy time. When we have drunk sex it’s hot af cus we get a lil freakier than usual and as fucked up as it sounds I get turned on when he feels me up while I’m drunk. We switchin positions till we get to missionary and he put the finger in the booty. I tell him to put two in this time and he does so but next thing I know he put his whole dick in my ass. We were both in shock cus we’ve been trying to do anal but never been able to since it would always hurt me. Once he was inside, he was only able to fuck me for a little bit since he had to finish immediately. And that’s so far was the hottest sex I’ve had so far. 🤤 I’m a lil sore rn but I’m just afraid I won’t be able to do it again sober 😭

I’m pretty sure she likes me but she’s one of my only friends at UCI and I don’t want to go back to being lonely if I mess it up. Also I’ve never been in a meaningful relationship, and I definitely don’t fit the “learn to love yourself first” criteria. It’s a big oof.

14346) Being your friend is suffocating. I can't talk about any of my mental health issues because of what you might do. I don't want to to feel like I'm comparing us. I don't want to leave you, but then you say shit like that, and I feel like just shutting down. I just wanted to be a good friend to you. But I honestly don't think I'm enough anymore. You need someone better. And I'm sorry I can't be that person.

He cycles through the same 7 phrases in every conversation and will reply to anything with either ""Oof," "Big oof," "Naaaaani" or any of his other pre-programmed speech patterns. The thing is sometimes they won't even make sense and seems really disingenuous when I tell him something deep and all he says is "OOOOOF."
I'm going to spill water on him soon to see if he short circuits.

Like wtf? Put your shit back so others have the convenience of grabbing their dumbbells when they work out. Were you not taught manners when you were growing up? When you were little, did you just leave your toys out when you were done playing with them?

14335) I used to slut around with all the cute boy I can meet because I'm scare of been in a relationship. But that all that change until I met this cute guy. He genuine, wise, and funny. He look young but he's actually very mature and older. He always look at me in the eyes when he talks to me. His voice is so deep and soothing. He makes me change the perspective of life and how I look at myself. For the first time in my life, I want to open my heart to someone. But he has a girlfriend (4 years together) and he loves her very much. Every time we together, I just want to scream out that I love him, but I don't want ruin his relationship because part of me want him to be happy. I feel the pain was too great to be around him so I slowly distance away from him.
He was my first love.

14334) I feel very alone. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about all these sad/depressing thoughts in my head. I do have friends but I don't want to continue to talk about my problems with them. 
I feel like each day I get up and go to school and work is just like i'm on autopilot. stuff just happens and i'm still just exhausted from putting on an act all day . I don't know what to do to change what is going on... mostly cause idk what is going on in my life...

14333) There's this girl I always see sitting in front of Taza at the Anteatery. She usually wears a blue hoodie, birkenstocks and earbuds. I think she's cute and I really want to get to know her, but at the same time, it would be weird to randomly go up to a stranger. Wtf do I do

14332) I know there’s HIV testing provided at UCI but I’m to shy to ask if it detects other STDs as well :/

Ryan Fox Trust me, the people who provide those services are professionals- they've seen it all. The earlier STIs/STDs are diagnosed, the easier it is to treat them. Don't let nerves stop you from getting the care you need!

14330) an update from 12344): we broke up last night after being together for 3 years. it was mutual but i was the one who brought it up. we still love each other but the distance is too much on me mentally while also trying to balance academics and extra curricular stuff. maybe one day once we have our lives together and we can be together physically then we can try again. after reading all the responses to my original post i didn’t want to believe that breaking up was ever an option because i really thought we could push through and make long distance work. i just hope in the end we made the right decision.

14329) So my mom visited me at my dorms today. I haven’t seen her in a few weeks and I haven’t gone home since the start of winter quarter. This was a first for me to stay on campus instead of going home for this long. I hate to say this but it’s not the most pleasant thing coming home because my family is very conservative and open about those views, while I am not. I talked with her about financial problems and it just hit me all of a sudden how my mom looked like she really missed me. I have been telling her I’m planning on staying over spring break and possibly summer break and I think she’s feeling lonely that I’m suddenly detaching myself from family time during breaks. It hurts my heart. So now I’m planning on going home for the weekend. Love your parents y’alls. You never know how much time they have left

14326) Real talk there’s no good barbers even close to Irvine. Getting a fade here is impossible because the barbers can’t blend and I end up spending money to get roasted by my friends back home

Anthony Tran I guess opening up a barber shop in Irvine sounds like a good idea, supply and demand, student barbers unite 😏👌🏻
